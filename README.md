### Description

The technology company "Smart Vehicle" is a company that wants to position itself in the market for renting and selling smart vehicles. However, it is identified that users do not finish the rental or purchase due to the manual processes that exist in the company since everything is through physical documents.

Wanting to systematize the vehicle administration process, the Smart Vehicle manager has contacted our team to develop the system that allows all this management to be carried out.

### Languages to use

The project will be developed with technologies like nodeJS, AngularJs, Loopback Framework, Bootstrap among others.
